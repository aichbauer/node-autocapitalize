# Introduction

> A small string manipulation library to capitalize letters based on rules

Install

```sh
$ npm i autocapitalize -S
```

and import the cuntion from `autocapitalize` and you are ready to go.

```js
const { autocapitalize } = require('autocapitalize');
```

Now you can manipulate any input string based on rules. Capitalize every first letter of a sentence, capitalize every word, or even capitalizing every character.

But see your self:

    <div>
      capitalize every first letter of a sentence. need that every day, right?
    </div>
    <div>
      Output:
    </div>
    <div>
      {autocapitalize('capitalize every first letter of a sentence. need that every day, right?', 'sentences')}
    </div>
  </div>

      Input:
