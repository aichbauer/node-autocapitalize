# Why?

I needed a fast and simple way to autocapitalize the first letter of a sentece. This library orients on the [autocapitalize feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize) although this is not for inputs on mobile devices per se. This library just borrows the implementation to bring it to strings.

This can come in handy if you have user based content and want to manipulate the string so that it is correctly displayed on a website. Or if you write long texts your self and want to auto capitalize the beginning of every sentence. You could also implement it to autocapitalize the input value on input fields, altough this is not recommended, because it breaks the natural user expiriance, but rules exist to break them, right? üòù
